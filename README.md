## ⚡ Why This Project?

Traditional financial advice often misses the big picture:

- Inflation, geopolitical risks, and digital currency controls are reshaping how we think about wealth  
- True financial resilience means blending **real assets**, **cash flow planning**, and **family legacy**  
- This project builds frameworks, tools, and coaching materials to help clients thrive — no hype, just real-world solutions
